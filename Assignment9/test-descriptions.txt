the data from the file and finds the way to escape through the rightmost point of the row 
given in the line first of the file.

Test Case - 2 :

Test case 2 checks for two consequent rocks in the ice-maze and checks whether it finds a 
way out to escape.This case set reads the data from the file and finds the way to escape 
through the rightmost point of the row given in the line first of the file.
